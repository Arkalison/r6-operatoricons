Thank you for your interest to contribute to this project. You're awesome! :+1:  

Below here are some guidelines for contributing to this project, please read them before creating a pull request/issue on Github.

Feel free to improve these guidelines with a pull request :)  
  
## Submitting an icon  
  
The best way to contribute an icon is by creating a pull request. They allow for better collaboration and also allow for proper reviews.  
  
**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)  
  
## Creating the icon  
  
If you want to create an icon, please use the [template.ai](https://github.com/MarcoPixel/r6-operatoricons/raw/master/template.ai) file which is located in the repository root folder.

The template includes the necessary guides for proper sizing & file layout, which we recommend for you to use since it makes every ones work so much easier :)  
  
**Here's an screenshot of the template loaded into Illustrator CC:**

After you're finished with your icon, export the file as **SVG** (screenshot of the settings) and a **4x PNG**. The file name should be the same for all three files and be lowercase. Create an **ZIP** file with all three files included and then move all files under their respective folders under `/static/assets/`.  
  
Here's an example on how it should look at the end:  
- `/static/assets/ai/operatorname.ai`
- `/static/assets/ai/operatorname.png`
- `/static/assets/ai/operatorname.svg`
- `/static/assets/ai/operatorname.zip` 
  
Now commit all changes to your fork and then you can create the pull request on Github.
  
## Icon requests  
  
Before creating an icon request, please go to issues and search if someone requested the icon already. If there is an open request, please add a ":+1:" to the main post.  
  
If the icon has not already been requested, [create an issue](https://github.com/MarcoPixel/r6-operatoricons/issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:) with a title of `Icon request: <name>` and add as much information as possible (if possible also add images of the icon, so we can start as soon as possible)
